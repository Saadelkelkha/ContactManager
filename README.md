# ContactManager
This program manages a contact file ('contact.txt') by adding details through the 'Add' function, including first and last name, telephone number, and type. The 'supprimer' function filters out 'personnel' contacts, updating the file with the retained entries. This script efficiently handles contact addition and removal based on specific criteria.
